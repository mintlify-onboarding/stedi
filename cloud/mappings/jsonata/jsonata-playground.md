[JSONata Playground](https://www.stedi.com/jsonata/playground) is a website that allows you to play around with [JSONata](https://jsonata.org) in a [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop)-like environment. You can learn more about the JSONata Playground by reading [this launch blog post](https://www.stedi.com/blog/jsonata-playground).

## Embedding the JSONata Playground into a website

### Good to know

The code snippet used for embedding the [JSONata Playground website](https://www.stedi.com/jsonata/playground) in an `iframe` will render the panels using a **horizontal layout** no matter the width of the parent site container.

2.  **(Optional)**: change the contents of the *Source*/*JSONata* panels.
