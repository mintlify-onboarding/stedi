You must create a mapping definition for each JSON document type you want to transform. The definition describes how to turn input JSON into output JSON.

Then, you can use mapping definitions with the Mappings API to [transform JSON documents](/docs/cloud/mappings/transform-json-documents) from one shape into another.

Refer to the following resources about creating and managing mapping definitions:

- [Mapping Definition Overview](/docs/cloud/mappings/manage-mappings/mapping-definition)
- [Use the Mappings UI Builder](/docs/cloud/mappings/manage-mappings/ui-guide)
- [Use the Mappings API](/docs/cloud/mappings/manage-mappings/api-guide)
