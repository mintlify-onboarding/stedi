## Cookies

To enable our systems to recognize your browser or device and to provide Stedi Offerings, we use cookies. For more information about cookies and how we use them, please read our [Cookie Notice](/docs/legal/cookie-notice).

## How We Share Personal Information

Information about our customers is an important part of our business and we are not in the business of selling our customers’ personal information to others; we share personal information only as described below. Controls that are either subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.

- Third-Party Service Providers: We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include: sending communications, processing payments, assessing credit and compliance risks, analyzing data, and conducting customer relationship management. These third party service providers have access to personal information needed to perform their functions.
- Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or services. In such transactions, personal information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the individual consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Stedi or substantially all of its assets are acquired, your information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
- Protection of Us and Others: We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce or apply our terms and other agreements, or protect the rights, property, or security of Stedi, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud prevention and detection and credit risk reduction.
- At Your Option: Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when personal information about you might be shared with third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.
