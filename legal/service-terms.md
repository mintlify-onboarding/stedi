# Service Terms

The Service Terms below govern your use of the Services. Capitalized terms used in these Service Terms but not defined below are either defined i) in the Stedi [Customer Agreement](/docs/legal/customer-agreement), or ii) in other agreements with us that govern your use of the Services (collectively, the “Agreement”).

## 1. Universal Service Terms (Applicable to all Services)

1.1. You may not transfer outside the Services any software (including related documentation) you obtain from us or third party licensors in connection with the Services without specific authorization to do so.

1.2. You must comply with current technical documentation applicable to the Services (including applicable developer guides) posted on the Stedi Site.

1.3. You will provide information or other materials related to Your Content as reasonably requested by us to verify your compliance with the Agreement. You will reasonably cooperate with us to identify the source of any problem with the Services that we reasonably believe may be attributable to Your Content or any end user materials that you control.

1.4. You will ensure that all information you provide to us via the Stedi Site (e.g., information provided in connection with your registration for the Services, requests for increased usage limits) is accurate, complete, and not misleading.

1.5. From time to time, we may apply upgrades, patches, bug fixes, or other maintenance to the Services and Stedi Content (“Maintenance”). We agree to use reasonable efforts to provide you with prior notice of any scheduled Maintenance (except for emergency Maintenance), and you agree to use reasonable efforts to comply with any Maintenance requirements that we notify you about.

1.6. If you and Stedi do not have an effective non-disclosure agreement in place, then you agree that you will not disclose Stedi Confidential Information (as defined in the Stedi Customer Agreement), except as required by law.

1.7. When you use a Service, you may be able to use or be required to use one or more other Services (each, an “Associated Service”), and when you use an Associated Service, you are subject to the terms and fees that apply to that Associated Service.

1.8. If you process the personal data of End Users or other identifiable individuals in your use of a Service, you are responsible for providing legally adequate privacy notices and obtaining necessary consents for the processing of such data. You represent to us that you have provided all necessary privacy notices and obtained all necessary consents. You are responsible for processing such data in accordance with applicable law.

1.9. Following closure of your Stedi account, we will delete Your Content in accordance with the Documentation.

1.10. In connection with your use of the Services, you are responsible for maintaining licenses and adhering to the license terms of any software you run. If we reasonably believe any of Your Content violates the law, infringes or misappropriates the rights of any third party, or otherwise violates a material term of the Agreement (including the Service Terms, or the Acceptable Use Policy) (“Prohibited Content”), we will notify you of the Prohibited Content and may request that such content be removed from the Services or access to it be disabled. If you do not remove or disable access to the Prohibited Content within 2 business days of our notice, we may remove or disable access to the Prohibited Content or suspend the Services to the extent we are not able to remove or disable access to the Prohibited Content. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may remove or disable access to any Prohibited Content without prior notice in connection with illegal content, where the content may disrupt or threaten the Services or in accordance with applicable law or any judicial, regulatory or other governmental order or request. In the event that we remove Your Content without prior notice, we will provide prompt notice to you unless prohibited by law. We terminate the accounts of repeat infringers in appropriate circumstances.

## 2. Betas and Previews

2.1. This Section describes the additional terms and conditions under which you may access and use certain features, technologies, and services made available to you by Stedi that are not yet generally available, including, but not limited to, any products, services, or features labeled “beta”, “preview”, “developer preview,” “customer preview,”, “public preview”, “pre-release”, or “experimental”, and any related Stedi Content (each, a “Beta Service”).

2.2. You must comply with all terms related to any Beta Service as posted on the Stedi Site or otherwise made available to you. Stedi may add or modify terms, including lowering or raising any usage limits, related to access to or use of any Beta Services at any time. Service Level Agreements do not apply to Beta Services.

2.3. You may provide Stedi with information relating to your access, use, testing, or evaluation of Beta Services, including observations or information regarding the performance, features, and functionality of Beta Services (“Test Observations”). Stedi will own and may use and evaluate all Test Observations for its own purposes. You will not use any Test Observations except for your internal evaluation purposes of any Beta Service.

2.4. Stedi may suspend or terminate your access to or use of any Beta Service at any time. Your access to and use of each Beta Service may automatically terminate upon the release of a generally available version of the applicable Beta Service or upon notice of termination by Stedi. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, after suspension or termination of your access to or use of any Beta Service for any reason, (a) you will not have any further right to access or use the applicable Beta Service, and (b) Your Content used in the applicable Beta Service may be deleted or inaccessible.

2.5. Test Observations, Suggestions concerning a Beta Service, and any other information about or involving (including the existence of) any Beta Service are considered Stedi Confidential Information.

2.6. WITHOUT LIMITING ANY DISCLAIMERS IN THE AGREEMENT OR THE SERVICE TERMS, BETA SERVICES AND BETA REGIONS ARE NOT READY FOR GENERAL COMMERCIAL RELEASE AND MAY CONTAIN BUGS, ERRORS, DEFECTS, OR HARMFUL COMPONENTS. ACCORDINGLY, AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THE AGREEMENT OR THESE SERVICES TERMS, STEDI IS PROVIDING BETA SERVICES AND BETA REGIONS TO YOU “AS IS.” STEDI AND ITS AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE REGARDING BETA SERVICES AND BETA REGIONS, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY THAT THE BETA SERVICES AND BETA REGIONS WILL BECOME GENERALLY AVAILABLE, BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR FREE, OR FREE OF HARMFUL COMPONENTS, OR THAT ANY CONTENT, INCLUDING YOUR CONTENT, WILL BE SECURE OR NOT OTHERWISE LOST OR DAMAGED. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY LAW, Stedi AND ITS AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF ANY COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. STEDI’S AND ITS AFFILIATES’ AND LICENSORS’ AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ANY BETA SERVICES AND BETA REGIONS WILL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU ACTUALLY PAY US UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR THE SERVICES THAT GAVE RISE TO THE CLAIM DURING THE 12 MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM.

## 3. Third-party Consultants

3.1. From time to time, Stedi may refer you to third-party consultants  (“Consultants”) who may offer their services (“Consultant Services”) as independent contractors, and are not employees of you or us.

For avoidance of doubt, any referral provided by Stedi is not a guarantee that the Consultant Services will be performed at any particular level of quality, speed, or to your specific requirements.

You will immediately revoke Consultant’s access to your Stedi account if you become aware of any violation of your obligations under the Agreement caused by a Consultant with access to your Stedi account.

3.3. You release us (and our agents and employees) from claims, demands, and damages (actual or consequential) of any and every kind and nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with your use of Consultants.
