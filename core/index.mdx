## Enable Core

To enable Core:

1. Navigate to [Core](https://www.stedi.com/app/core/).
1. Click **Enable Core**.

## Configure trading partners

Core is designed to quickly [onboard new trading partners](/core/configuration). This includes specifying the transaction sets you plan to exchange with that partner and the communication methods you plan to use.

## Configure destinations

You can optionally define [destinations](/events/destinations) to automatically send transactions and other events from Stedi to any API endpoint.

## Parse and generate EDI

Once you configure Core for a trading partner, you can use Core to receive, validate, parse, generate, and send EDI files. Visit [Parse EDI](/docs/core/parsing-edi) and [Generate EDI](/docs/core/generating-edi) for details.
