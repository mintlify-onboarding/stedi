Typical EDI implementation guides are formatted as PDFs, Word documents, or CSV files. The following video demonstrates how to interpret a PDF implementation guide and use it to create a user-friendly, machine-readable Stedi guide that you can share with trading partners.

Most users will never need to build a guide from scratch. Stedi has thousands of pre-built guides available in the [Stedi Network](https://www.stedi.com/edi/network) catalog. Once you locate the correct guide in the catalog, you can click the **Import guide into your account** button to create your copy of the guide and use it with Core by adding it to a partnership's [transaction settings](/core/configuration/transaction-settings#using-guides).

If you can't find your partner or guide listed in the catalog, you can [submit a request](https://www.stedi.com/products/guides/accelerator) and we'll build it for you for free within 1-2 business days using our best practices.

If you have experience building EDI guides already and you want to get started immediately – or if you want to see the power and flexibility of Stedi guides for yourself – you can create a guide using the self-service guide builder by following the steps outlined in this video.

The video includes examples of how to:

- Create a new Stedi guide
- Interpret requirements in a PDF implementation guide, such as whether segments are required or optional
- Set up variants for N1 Loops and segments that can occur more than once in a transaction set
- Use the Stedi guide's built-in EDI Inspector to test an EDI sample file against the guide's specifications

Visit [Customize Guides](/core/guides/customize-guides) for full details about building custom Stedi guides, including how to add segments, create conditional elements, handle hierarchy and loops, and more.
