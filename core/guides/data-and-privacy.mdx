 [Contact us](https://www.stedi.com/contact) with additional questions. We also recommend reviewing our official [Data and Privacy](/data-privacy) page.

### How does the EDI Inspector in Guides use my data?

In short, we don't. EDI Inspector performs the validation without your EDI content ever leaving your browser. Any pasted EDI content in the EDI Inspector stays on your machine and is never sent over the wire.

### I'm using EDI Translate API and providing a guide (`guideId`) as an input. How does EDI Translate use my data?

Stedi does not use your data. Please refer to [Data and Privacy](/data-privacy) for details.
