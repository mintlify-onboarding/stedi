## Public guides

Guides are private by default. Only members of your Stedi account can use private guides.

When you [make a guide public](#make-a-guide-public), your trading partners can view it as interactive web page and validate EDI documents against it instantly in their web browsers. Visit the [Stedi Network](https://www.stedi.com/edi/network) for examples.

When a guide is public, anyone with the link can:

<Card title="View the guide web page" icon="browser" icontype="duotone">
</Card>
<Card title="Print the guide" icon="print" icontype="duotone">
</Card>

</Card>
