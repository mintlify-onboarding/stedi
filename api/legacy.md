A product is labeled **Legacy** when there is a newer version of the product with significant improvements, or an alternate product exists that better addresses the same use cases.

We continue to support legacy products according to our SLAs. If you are new to Stedi, we strongly recommend using our latest products to build your integration. If you think a legacy product is a better fit for your integration, please [contact support](https://www.stedi.com/contact) and we'll be happy to talk through your use case.
