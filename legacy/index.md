At Stedi, a product is labeled **Legacy** when there is a newer version of the product with significant changes, or an alternative product exists that better addresses the same use cases.

We will continue to support legacy products according to our SLAs. If you are new to Stedi, we strongly recommend using our latest products to build your integration.
