The EDI Translate API is billed based on usage. There are no minimum fees, monthly commitments, or upfront costs to use this product.

Usage is calculated based on request count and MB processed.

A request is defined as a single call to the EDI Translate API, regardless of how many transactions (e.g. ST segments) are in the payload.
