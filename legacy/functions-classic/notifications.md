You can invoke a Stedi function automatically when certain events occur in other Stedi products. This allows you to kick off an automated workflow. For example, when a trading partner uploads an EDI message to a bucket, the function can pick it up, call EDI Translate, and send the result to your internal API.

## Stedi Buckets

Stedi Buckets is the only product that supports sending notifications right now. It can invoke a function whenever an object is added to a bucket. You enable these notifications by configuring the bucket that sends them. You donâ€™t need to configure anything on the side of the function.
